![ai-to-psd](images/cover.jpg)

## Description
The script may help to prepare vector layers for export from AI to PSD file.  
All solid filled objects remain vector in the PSD.


## Installation 

1. [Download archive] and unzip
2. Place `ai-to-psd.jsx` in the Illustrator Scripts folder:
	- OS X: `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CS#/Presets.localized/en_GB/Scripts`
	- Windows (32 bit): `C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS#\Presets\en_GB\Scripts\`
	- Windows (64 bit): `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS# (64 Bit)\Presets\en_GB\Scripts\`
3. Load `Ai-to-Psd.aia` action file by `Window â†’ Actions â†’ Load Actionsâ€¦ `
5. Restart Illustrator

## Usage 

If you want to save the vector stroke in the PSD, then you have to select the object and use `Object â†’ Path â†’ Outline Stroke`. 

If you have a large group of small objects, e.g. hair brush draws, fur or outlined text, it'd be better to combine such elements into the `Compound Path with Object â†’ Compound Path â†’ Make` before the script is executed. 

1. Open document in Adobe Illustrator
2. Choose `File â†’ Scripts â†’ ai-to-psd`
3. Wait for the message of completion
4. Export the file to PSD via `File â†’ Export â†’ Export As...`

*Attention: Meshes, objects with a gradient fill, pattern, various strokes, Open Path can not be left as vectors after the export, but they are automatically grouped to be separate raster layers in the PSD.*

## System Requirements

Should work with Adobe Illustrator CS6 and higher.   
The script has been tested on Illustrator CS6 (Win), Illustrator CC 2017 (OS X El Capitan).
