* Version 2.0 of the script doesn't need to load the helper Action file. If you have any of previous versions, you may delete 'Ai-to-Psd' set from `Windows ‚Üí Actions` right after upgrade.


## Description
The script may help to prepare vector layers for export from AI to PSD file.  
All `solid filled` objects remain vector in the PSD.

## Installation 

1. [Download archive] and unzip   
2. Place `Ai2Psd.jsx` in the Illustrator Scripts folder:
	- OS X: `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator [vers.]/Presets.localized/en_GB/Scripts`
	- Windows (32 bit): `C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator [vers.]\Presets\en_GB\Scripts\`
	- Windows (64 bit): `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator [vers.] (64 Bit)\Presets\en_GB\Scripts\`
3. Restart Illustrator

## Usage 

If you want to save the vector stroke in the PSD, then you have to select the object and use `Object ‚Üí Path ‚Üí Outline Stroke`. 

If you have a large group of small objects, e.g. hair brush draws, fur or outlined text, it'd be better to combine such elements into the `Compound Path with Object ‚Üí Compound Path ‚Üí Make` before the script is executed. 

1. Open document in Adobe Illustrator
2. Choose `File ‚Üí Scripts ‚Üí ai-to-psd`
3. Wait for the message of completion
4. Export the file to PSD via `File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Export As...`

*Attention: Meshes, objects with a gradient fill, pattern, various strokes, Open Path can not be left as vectors after the export, but they are automatically grouped to be separate raster layers in the PSD.*
